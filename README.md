# CSS Grid
An HTML and CSS static site that utilizes CSS Grid

The main objective of this site is to get familiar laying out responsive pages without using JavaScript or frameworks like Twitter's Bootstrap.

CSS Grid are compatible with most modern browsers and give us an opportunity to avoid all of the common hacks seen today.

## Grid Properties

When creating this site I am going to attempt to use all of the properties of CSS Grid.
As soon as these properties are featured in the site I will check them off.

- [ ] display: grid  
- - This sets the selected CSS element as the grid container
- [ ] grid-template-columns:
- -
- [ ] grid-template-rows:    px, pt, em, fr, %, repeat({amt}, size)
- -
- [ ] grid-template-areas:   <name>
- -
- [ ] grid-auto-columns:     px, pt, em, fr, %
- -
- [ ] grid-auto-rows:        px, pt, em, fr, %
- -
- [ ] grid-auto-flow:        px, pt, em, fr, %
- -
- [ ] grid-column-gap:       px, pt, em, fr, %
- -
- [ ] grid-row-gap:          px, pt, em, fr, %
- -
- [ ] justify-items:         start, center, end, stretch (default)
- -
- [ ] justify-self:         start, center, end, stretch (default)
- -
- [ ] align-items:           start, center, end, stretch (default)
- -
- [ ] align-self:            start, center, end, stretch (default)
- -

## The Site

To best demonstrate the power of the CSS Grid I am going to make a single page layout so that you can scroll your little heart out. The site is going to be hosted in GitHub Pages.

What I am not certain about is what kind of content I am going to put on it. Possibly an informational site about one of my my many interest.
