                        <small>
                          This guide was inspired by a talk by Morten Rand-Hendriksen
                          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txZq7Laz7_4"><i>CSS Grid Changes Everything</i>.</a>
                          After watching that I was convinced that I wanted to play with this CSS property,
                           real quick. A lot of the resources I show here originates from the talk, but the finer details come from this
                          <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">guide</a> from CSS-Tricks, and this

                <h4>What is a CSS Grid?</h4>
                <p>
                    CSS Grid (<code>display: grid; </code>) is designed to help you create organized CSS layouts using a grid system.
                    It's similar to using (<code>display: flexbox; </code>) except it is two-dimensional.
                </p>

                <h4> Mozilla Developer Network defines it as:</h4>
                <quote>
                  The grid CSS property is a shorthand property that sets all of the explicit grid properties (grid-template-rows,
                  grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas), all the implicit grid properties (grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns,
                  and grid-auto-flow), and the gutter properties (grid-column-gap and grid-row-gap) in a single declaration.
                </quote>

                <h4>Why would you use this?</h4>
                <p>
                    Well, almost everything you know about styling a webpage is a hack.
                    Using tables, floats, and a variety of other tricks to layout a page were just hacks to make some things work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All you need is a container or a wrapper around your content.
                    <xmp>
                        <section class="container">
                    </xmp>

                    Then you just style it with: <code> display: grid </code>
                    For example:
                        <xmp>
                            .container {
                                display: grid;
                            }
                        </xmp>

                    Pretty simple, right?
